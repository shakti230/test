    "Summary statistics, such as sums and means are vey useful for describing general trends and aspects of data, but statistics alone can not fully depict any data set. There is a danger in relying only on summary statistics and ignoring the overall distribution [1]. Francis John \"Frank\" Anscombe (13 May 1918 – 17 October 2001), an English statistician realized this in 1973 and created several data sets, all with several identical statistical properties, to demonstrate the importance of visualizing data and also to highlight the effect that outliers can have on statistical findings of a dataset. Anscombe’s Quartet consists of four data sets, that appear to have similar summary statistics, yet when graphed the datasets tell a very different story. Each dataset consists of eleven X,Y pairs. \n",
